toucHNews is a simple, interactive Hacker News news feed for the Mac Touch Bar.

It lives persistently in the "Control Strip", the small cluster of icons permanantly displayed on the right side of the Touch Bar.  When its icon (cleverly labeled `hn`) is clicked, it expands to display the latest headlines from Hacker News across the Touch Bar.

It is written in Rust.

## Interface 

One headline is shown at a time.  To interact:

* Single tap the headline to show the next one.
* Double tap the article counter to return to the beginning.
* Swipe right until the text turns blue and release to open the article in your default browser
* Swipe left until the text turns orange to permanently remove the article from the bar.
* Tap the 'X' in the circle on the left to minimize back into the Control Strip.
* Tap the 'X' in the square on the right to quit.
